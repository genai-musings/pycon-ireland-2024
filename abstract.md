## Title : Leveraging the GitHub Ecosystem for Python Projects: From Hello World to Docker Deployment

This session will only cover some very basic Python code, rather it will focus on how to harness the GitHub ecosystem for creating, managing and deploying Python projects. Starting from a simple "Hello World" application, this session will guide you through setting up a templated GitHub repository optimized for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD).

Key Points:

- Template GitHub Repository:

  Structure a repository tailored for Python projects.
  Utilize issue templates to standardize and streamline issue tracking and resolution.
  Create a Dockerfile to containerize the Python application.
  Use GitHub Actions to set up CD pipelines to build, scan, and push Docker images to a container registry.

- CI:

  Spell Checking: Maintain documentation quality with codespell.
  Link Verification: Ensure valid URLs using lychee-action.
  Linting: Enforce coding standards with flake8 and pylint.
  Unit Testing: Verify code correctness with pytest.
  Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Identify vulnerabilities with Bandit.

- CD:

  Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Perform security testing with OWASP ZAP.
  Container Security: Scan Docker images with Trivy.
  Build and Deploy to Docker Hub: Automate Docker builds and push to Docker Hub.
  Deployment Automation: Deploy application as a Docker container to Docker Hub.

The session will showcase how leveraging the GitHub ecosystem can enhance and optimize your Python development workflow.
